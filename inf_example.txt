Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
Avoid this place !
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
